 Programming
Here are my projects, which help me learn how to code with Python and C.  
**Warning**: This project is designed for learning purposes only. It is not intended for professional use and is suitable for school or study projects.

## Installation 
Before we begin, we need to install Python and a text editor. In my case, I use `nvim`:  
```
sudo apt install python neovim git 
```
It depends on you which writing tool you want to use. <br>
**Notice:** If you're using a different Linux distribution, make sure to use the correct `package manager`. The steps should be similar across distributions.

## Clone Repository / Install Projects
To install my projects, follow these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ne4ec/Programming
cd Programming
ls
```
Now you are in my repository.<br>
From this point, the choice of which project to launch is entirely up to you.
